      <title>Digitally Reproducing MOF Material Synthesis Conditions For Quantitative Comparison</title>
      <link>https://SarkisovTeam.github.io/group-website/project/synthesis-digitisation/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 17 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://SarkisovTeam.github.io/group-website/project/synthesis-digitisation/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Metal organic framework (MOF) materials represent an exciting new development in porous materials science, with myriad applications in fields as diverse as carbon capture, catalysis, and water harvesting. 
However, with tens of thousands of MOF syntheses identified, reproducing a reported framework or identifying the best synthesis route is a complex and often frustrating task. 
Further, these syntheses are often reported as plain text, preventing quantitative comparison between different studies. 
In this research theme, we are applying text mining and natural language processing tools to digitise MOF synthesis methods. Using this depth-first text mining framework, we aim to perform optimisation of synthesis methods solely from pre-existing published data, accelerating methodology development and hence implementation of MOF materials in larger-scale applications.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Screening Complex Adsorption Phenomena Using Advanced Monte Carlo Simulations</title>
      <link>https://SarkisovTeam.github.io/group-website/project/screening-complex/</link>

      <guid>https://SarkisovTeam.github.io/group-website/project/screening-complex/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Screening adsorption behaviour of porous materials is highly valuable to select candidates for scale-up and direct novel materials discovery. 
However, current methods are limited to adsorption of either very small ro simple molecules, unable to describe complex adsorption phenomena like water capture or arene isomer separation. 
We are developing methods to accelerate the estimation of adsorption properties for these complex material applications, enabling high-throughput screening for an ever-larger series of applications.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dynamic Mean Field Theory to Study Fluid Transport Mechanisms in Mixed Matrix Membranes</title>
      <link>https://SarkisovTeam.github.io/group-website/project/dmft/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 25 Jul 2022 21:41:10 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://SarkisovTeam.github.io/group-website/project/dmft/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) are promising materials for membrane gas separations. The idea of an MMM is to combine excellent separation performance of a filler material (common choices include Metal Organic Frameworks, zeolites, and carbon nanotubes/nanosheets) with the good processability and stability of the continuous phase (which is often a polymer material). Although this idea is very appealing and elegant in principle, practical implementation of MMMs faces a number of challenges related to how the filler phase is distributed within the continuous phase, defects at the interfaces between the two phases and so on. On a fundamental level, the detailed fluid transport mechanisms in a heterogeneous material, such as MMM, remain to be elucidated, and this prevents the development of rational approaches to engineering better MMMs.&lt;br&gt;
The dynamic mean field theory (DMFT) is a statistical mechanical theory. This method provide qualitatively accurate results comparing with atomistic simulations while taking 2-3 orders of magnitude less computational power. The DMFT also preserves the physical transport process making it a suitable tool for studying the fluid transport phenomena in heterogeneous materials.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Advanced Featurization of MOF Pores for Characterization, Visualization, and Materials Exploration</title>
      <link>https://SarkisovTeam.github.io/group-website/project/matchar/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 25 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://SarkisovTeam.github.io/group-website/project/matchar/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Most of the state-of-the-art approaches to computational materials discovery of MOFs via machine learning (ML), can be summarized in terms of three key components. A way to sample the phase space of MOFs (databases, material generators etc.), a way to make predictions (a regression model, a data lookup table etc.), and a way to select/optimize materials to maximize the desired property(s) (gradient descent, genetic algorithms, Bayes optimization etc.). How we represent materials plays a key-role in all these steps. In adsorption, the shape, size, and connectivity of the cavities often play a bigger role than the chemistry of the individual structural building blocks (SBUs) that make up the MOF. Arriving at numerical features that capture the 3D confining environment of a nanoporous materials remains a challenging task till date. We develop novel workflows and code, using molecular simulations, advanced framework exploration, image processing and cheminformatics, to provide foundations that can help make the most of existing descriptors, such as pore size distributions, energy histograms, surface areas etc. This is relatively new and ongoing project for us, so please stay tuned for upcoming publications and codes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Developing ANN Surrogate Models to Replace High-fidelity Pressure Swing Adsorption Process Simulations</title>
      <link>https://SarkisovTeam.github.io/group-website/project/psa/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 25 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://SarkisovTeam.github.io/group-website/project/psa/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) processes are used extensively for many important gas separations. One of the advantages of PSA is routed in it&amp;rsquo;s cyclic nature: one can configure a variety of &amp;lsquo;cycles&amp;rsquo; with different sequences and steps to achieve the best separation performance using a given adsorbent material. Designing such cycles, however, can be rather complex due to the combined heat- and mass-transfer fronts that arise within the adsorption columns. As such, numerical simulation and optimisation are used extensively to search for the optimal process configuration and operating conditions. For a single operating condition, it is entirely possible that hundreds of cycles need to be simulated in order to reach the cyclic steady state. This means that optimising the process performance for large databases of adsorbents - which requires thousands of process evaluations per material - becomes computationally intractable. As the separation potential of an adsorbent can only be accurately assessed using detailed process simulation and optimisation, there is a substantial need to expedite these simulations for high-throughput applications. Recent efforts have turned towards machine learning. In one approach, an artificial neural network (ANN) model can be trained to predict the key performance indicators of a PSA process using the operating conditions and features of the adsorbent as the inputs. In this way, one can potentially predict the performance of any arbitrary adsorbent at a fraction of the computational cost (from thousands of CPU hours to a few CPU minutes). In our work, we leverage this idea to predict the performance of thousands of metal-organic frameworks with the objective of understanding uncertainties in multiscale high-throughput screening workflows, exploring adsorbent structure-property-process relationships, and much more!&lt;/p&gt;

      <pubDate>Sun, 17 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://SarkisovTeam.github.io/group-website/project/zeolite_zijun/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This project will employ a broad range of multi-scale modelling methods, including Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulations and process simulations, to explore adsorption processes in porous materials. The primary focus will be on the materials exhibiting unusual or advanced effects, such as cation-exchanged zeolites, metal-organic frameworks with open metal sites and flexible metal-organic materials. Using these materials and simulations, the project will identify opportunities for advanced, energy efficient separations of gases and liquids in the chemical engineering industry.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The New Beginnings 2022</title>
      <link>https://SarkisovTeam.github.io/group-website/post/27-8-2022philosophy/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://SarkisovTeam.github.io/group-website/post/27-8-2022philosophy/</guid>
      <description>&lt;!-- The New Beginnings 2022   --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I moved to Manchester in January 2020, starting here as the new Head of Department of Chemical Engineering. On the 17th of March, 2022, we had to shut down all the labs and leave the buildings due to the onset of the COVID pandemic. What followed was quite a challenging time for the academic groups and the universities at large.
Now, two years later, my research group has relocated to the new building (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mecd.manchester.ac.uk&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;https://www.mecd.manchester.ac.uk&lt;/a&gt;), new group members will be joining us throughout the year and we have plenty of exciting and challenging ideas to work on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To explain the research vision of the group, let me propose the following imaginary scenario. A chemist envisages a new porous material (let say a MOF, because it is a hot topic at the moment). This material has been already synthesized in the lab, or it can be simply contemplated on a piece of paper. What is this material good for? Sensing? Some adsorption separation processes? Is it flexible? Is it stable with respect to water? Is there a cheap way to synthesize it in industrial quantities?
In general, answering these questions requires an extensive and diverse experimental campaign in terms of number of people, experimental techniques and time. However, recently it became possible to answer some of these questions using simulations on a computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, prediction of  adsorption equilibria given structure of a porous material using molecular simulations has become an stablished tool of enquiry. These data can be used at a different level in a process simulation to explore how this material would behave in a real process, such as the PSA cycle for carbon capture. We now have tools and techniques developed in our group to obtain structural features of porous materials, link them to the functional characteristics such as adsorption behaviour, using ML methods, and then, in turn, link process behaviour to adsorption behaviour, also using ML models, bypassing (time consuming) simulations all together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More recently, we have been leveraging the power of NLP methods to extract useful information on material synthesis from the already published data. Possibly, it will lead to the Digital Assistant system which would advise the experimentalists on the most plausible (cheap, green) conditions for high yield material synthesis.
And hence, let&amp;rsquo;s return to our chemist. She now drops the file with the new (or hypothetical) material structure into a web-based platform, which returns the structural characteristics of the new material (pore sizes, how they are connected), equilibrium adsorption data for target applications, provides a visual guide on the structure and properties of the material, explores its behaviour in a relevant industrial process, and suggests a cheap way to make it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the computational side, this is a very challenging endeavour as well, requiring many different types of expertise. And this is what our team is all about: we bring diverse expertise and methods together to advance material informatics to accelerate the deployment of sustainable chemical engineering technologies, while answering fundamental questions, programming a lot, and having a lot of fun in the process. Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
