One of the advantages of PSA is routed in it’s cyclic nature: one can configure a variety of ‘cycles’ with different sequences and steps to achieve the best separation performance using a given adsorbent material. Designing such cycles, however, can be rather complex due to the combined heat- and mass-transfer fronts that arise within the adsorption columns. As such, numerical simulation and optimisation are used extensively to search for the optimal process configuration and operating conditions. For a single operating condition, it is entirely possible that hundreds of cycles need to be simulated in order to reach the cyclic steady state. This means that optimising the process performance for large databases of adsorbents - which requires thousands of process evaluations per material - becomes computationally intractable. As the separation potential of an adsorbent can only be accurately assessed using detailed process simulation and optimisation, there is a substantial need to expedite these simulations for high-throughput applications. Recent efforts have turned towards machine learning. In one approach, an artificial neural network (ANN) model can be trained to predict the key performance indicators of a PSA process using the operating conditions and features of the adsorbent as the inputs. In this way, one can potentially predict the performance of any arbitrary adsorbent at a fraction of the computational cost (from thousands of CPU hours to a few CPU minutes). In our work, we leverage this idea to predict the performance of thousands of metal-organic frameworks with the objective of understanding uncertainties in multiscale high-throughput screening workflows, exploring adsorbent structure-property-process relationships, and much more!\n","date":1658707200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1658707200,"objectID":"0f6a8b423a55553b8b49401f355d7e5f","permalink":"https://SarkisovTeam.github.io/group-website/project/psa/","publishdate":"2022-07-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/group-website/project/psa/","section":"project","summary":"Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) processes are used extensively for many important gas separations.

As a starting point and to establish some basic definitions of properties analogous to those in the off-lattice systems, we consider transport across simple models of porous materials represented by a slit pore in a chemical potential gradient. Using this simple model, we investigate the distribution of density and flux under steady state conditions, define the permeability across the system, and explore how this property depends on the length of the pore and the solid–fluid interactions. Among other effects, we observe that the flux in the system goes through a maximum as the solid–fluid interaction is varied from weak to strong. This effect is dominated by the behavior of the fluid near the walls and is also confirmed by off-lattice molecular dynamics simulations. We further extend this study to explore transport across heterogeneous slit pore channels composed of two solids with different values of solid–fluid interaction strengths. We demonstrate that the lattice models and dynamic mean field theory provide a useful framework to pose questions on the accuracy and applicability of the classical theories of transport across heterogeneous porous systems.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Application of the dynamic mean field theory to fluid transport in slit pores","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Amir Farmahini","Shreenath Krishnamurthy","Daniel Friedrich","Stefano Brandani","Lev Sarkisov"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1627776000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1627776000,"objectID":"a019914a86ca0f6f2693e81845a0896f","permalink":"https://SarkisovTeam.github.io/group-website/publication/farmahini_etal_2021_chemcalreviews/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/group-website/publication/farmahini_etal_2021_chemcalreviews/","section":"publication","summary":"Computational screening methods have changed the way new materials and processes are discovered and designed.

Practical implementation of these workflows requires: (1) accurate calculation of various material properties some of which are poorly estimated so far (e.g. specific heat capacity), (2) consistent treatment of the process variables that cannot be calculated from molecular simulations but are crucial for process modelling (e.g. pellet size and porosity), (3) improving computational efficiency of the workflows by reducing the search space in process optimization. In this study, we focus on four representative materials in the context of the vacuum swing adsorption process for carbon capture to probe these issues. We report on several observations with important implications for the theoretically achievable process efficiency, the computational efficiency of the multiscale workflows and on the consistency of materials rankings. We demonstrate that if size and porosity of adsorbent pellets are optimized, efficiency and productivity of the process can be substantially improved. We show the maximum performance of a material achievable in a particular process depends on a complex combination of both intrinsic material properties and process variables. This is evident from the ranking of the materials being different for a process with optimizable pellet size and porosity, compared to the reference case where these two properties are fixed. Analysis of the cycles on the Pareto fronts reveals common patterns for these variables for all the materials under consideration. We demonstrate that this observation reflects some optimum balance in the competition between diffusive processes into the pellet and convection flow processes across the bed. We attempt to capture this balance in a universal dimensionless metric which is explicitly proposed here for the first time. Application of such universal metrics could be very important in improving the efficiency of the optimization algorithms by narrowing down the multidimensional search space.","tags":["Adsorption","Carbon Capture","Molecular Simulation","Metal-Organic Frameworks","Pressure Swing Adsorption","Process Optimisation"],"title":"Exploring new sources of efficiency in process-driven materials screening for post-combustion carbon capture","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Amir Farmahini","Shreenath Krishnamurthy","Daniel Friedrich","Stefano Brandani","Lev Sarkisov"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1538352000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1538352000,"objectID":"8fae0e431b496637ecf218cd2566e564","permalink":"https://SarkisovTeam.github.io/group-website/publication/farmahini_etal_2018_iec/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/group-website/publication/farmahini_etal_2018_iec/","section":"publication","summary":"Multiscale material screening strategies combine molecular simulations and process modeling to identify the best performing adsorbents for a particular application, such as carbon capture.

In this article, we focus on the challenges associated with the interface between molecular and process levels of description. We explore how predictions of the material performance in the actual process depend on the accuracy of molecular simulations, on the procedures to feed the equilibrium adsorption data into the process simulator, and on the structural characteristics of the pellets, which are not available from molecular simulations and should be treated as optimization parameters. The presented analysis paves the way for more consistent and robust multiscale material screening strategies.","tags":["Adsorption","Carbon Capture","Molecular Simulation","Metal-Organic Frameworks","Pressure Swing Adsorption","Process Optimisation"],"title":"From Crystal to Adsorption Column: Challenges in Multiscale Computational Screening of Materials for Adsorption Separation Processes","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"6d99026b9e19e4fa43d5aadf147c7176","permalink":"https://SarkisovTeam.github.io/group-website/contact/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/group-website/contact/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"c1d17ff2b20dca0ad6653a3161942b64","permalink":"https://SarkisovTeam.github.io/group-website/people/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/group-website/people/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"6fcae98d7df3b6c44952e7b5fed181e3","permalink":"https://SarkisovTeam.github.io/group-website/software/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/group-website/software/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":["Lev Sarkisov"],"categories":null,"content":" I moved to Manchester in January 2020, starting here as the new Head of Department of Chemical Engineering. On the 17th of March, 2022, we had to shut down all the labs and leave the buildings due to the onset of the COVID pandemic. What followed was quite a challenging time for the academic groups and the universities at large. Now, two years later, my research group has relocated to the new building (https://www.mecd.manchester.ac.uk), new group members will be joining us throughout the year and we have plenty of exciting and challenging ideas to work on.\nTo explain the research vision of the group, let me propose the following imaginary scenario. A chemist envisages a new porous material (let say a MOF, because it is a hot topic at the moment). This material has been already synthesized in the lab, or it can be simply contemplated on a piece of paper. What is this material good for? Sensing? Some adsorption separation processes? Is it flexible? Is it stable with respect to water? Is there a cheap way to synthesize it in industrial quantities? In general, answering these questions requires an extensive and diverse experimental campaign in terms of number of people, experimental techniques and time. However, recently it became possible to answer some of these questions using simulations on a computer.\nFor example, prediction of adsorption equilibria given structure of a porous material using molecular simulations has become an stablished tool of enquiry. These data can be used at a different level in a process simulation to explore how this material would behave in a real process, such as the PSA cycle for carbon capture. We now have tools and techniques developed in our group to obtain structural features of porous materials, link them to the functional characteristics such as adsorption behaviour, using ML methods, and then, in turn, link process behaviour to adsorption behaviour, also using ML models, bypassing (time consuming) simulations all together.\nMore recently, we have been leveraging the power of NLP methods to extract useful information on material synthesis from the already published data. Possibly, it will lead to the Digital Assistant system which would advise the experimentalists on the most plausible (cheap, green) conditions for high yield material synthesis. And hence, let’s return to our chemist. She now drops the file with the new (or hypothetical) material structure into a web-based platform, which returns the structural characteristics of the new material (pore sizes, how they are connected), equilibrium adsorption data for target applications, provides a visual guide on the structure and properties of the material, explores its behaviour in a relevant industrial process, and suggests a cheap way to make it.\nOn the computational side, this is a very challenging endeavour as well, requiring many different types of expertise. And this is what our team is all about: we bring diverse expertise and methods together to advance material informatics to accelerate the deployment of sustainable chemical engineering technologies, while answering fundamental questions, programming a lot, and having a lot of fun in the process.
