Screening adsorption behaviour of porous materials is highly valuable to select candidates for scale-up and direct novel materials discovery. 
However, current methods are limited to adsorption of either very small ro simple molecules, unable to describe complex adsorption phenomena like water capture or arene isomer separation. 
We are developing methods to accelerate the estimation of adsorption properties for these complex material applications, enabling high-throughput screening for an ever-larger series of applications.
