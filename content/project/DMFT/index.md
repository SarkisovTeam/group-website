# Mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) are promising materials for membrane gas separations. The idea of an MMM is to combine excellent separation performance of a filler material (common choices include Metal Organic Frameworks, zeolites, and carbon nanotubes/nanosheets) with the good processability and stability of the continuous phase (which is often a polymer material). Although this idea is very appealing and elegant in principle, practical implementation of MMMs faces a number of challenges related to how the filler phase is distributed within the continuous phase, defects at the interfaces between the two phases and so on. On a fundamental level, the detailed fluid transport mechanisms in a heterogeneous material, such as MMM, remain to be elucidated, and this prevents the development of rational approaches to engineering better MMMs.   
#The dynamic mean field theory (DMFT) is a statistical mechanical theory. This method provide qualitatively accurate results comparing with atomistic simulations while taking 2-3 orders of magnitude less computational power. The DMFT also preserves the physical transport process making it a suitable tool for studying the fluid transport phenomena in heterogeneous materials.
