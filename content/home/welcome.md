Welcome to the research group of Prof. Lev Sarkisov at the University of Manchester (UoM), UK. From carbon capture to sensing, from drug delivery to batteries and energy storage, advances in these technologies are driven by the availability of new, bespoke porous materials. The mission of our group is accelerate the discovery and deployment of porous materials for challenging engineering problems by understanding adsorption and transport phenomena across scales. For this, we combine methods of statistical mechanics, molecular simulation, process modelling and ML models into a multiscale digital discovery workflow. We strive to make our research fully reproducible and our software is open source to aid the researchers around the world.
