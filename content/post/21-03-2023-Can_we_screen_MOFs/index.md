To avoid the most severe impacts of climate change, we need to deploy carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) technologies on a scale that matches human industrial activity's emissions. However, the differences in scale, composition, and technical requirements between various emission sectors require technologies that can be optimised for various applications. Adsorption-based processes using metal organic frameworks (MOFs) offer a significant advantage because they can be tailored for specific CO\textsubscript{2} capture sources by optimising the adsorption cycle and MOF properties. Computational screening of MOFs for carbon capture has therefore captivated the attention of the scientific community.
