To avoid the most severe impacts of climate change, we need to deploy carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) technologies on a scale that matches human industrial activity's emissions. However, the differences in scale, composition, and technical requirements between various emission sectors require technologies that can be optimised for various applications. Cyclical adsorption processes offer a significant advantage because they can be tailored for specific CO<sub>2</sub> capture sources by optimising the adsorption cycle and adsorbent properties.  

The questions is, <i>can we find the best adsorbent for carbon capture?</i> Amongst the existing pool of porous materials, this endeavour is akin to finding a needle in a haystack. Yet, the demand for CCS has prompted many research groups to pose, and attempt to answer, this exact question. Quite often the focus of these studies is the subclass of porous materials known as metal organic frameworks (MOFs). These materials are constructed from organic linkers and inorganic metal node complexes in a lego-like fashion (see figure below).

 Currently, over 100,000 experimentally synthesised MOFs have been reported in the Cambridge Structural Database. However, by virtue of their modular nature, the number of possible MOF structures, chemistries, and therefore properties, are virtually infinite. We therefore use high throughput computational screening (HTCS) as a tool to sift through these structures and identify the most promising MOFs for carbon capture applications. This approach requires three things, primarily:  
<ol>
  <li><i>Database of MOF candidates to evaluate</i></li>
  <li><i>Property data which describes the material in cyclical adsorption processes</i></li>
  <li><i>A numerical model which simulates the cyclical adsorption process</i></li>
</ol>
