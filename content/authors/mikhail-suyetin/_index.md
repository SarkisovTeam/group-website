role: Postdoctoral Research Associate 
# weight: 
bio: My research is focused on performing computational screening on databases of MOFs employing classical molecular dynamics, Grand Canonical Monte-Carlo, and density functional theory approaches, as well as the application of Machine Learning methods for revealing hidden structure-property relationships and designing new MOFs with advanced properties. I am interested alos in discovering new applications of MOFs, for example desigining proof-of-concepts.
interests: [molecular simulations, MD, GCMC, DFT, workflow development, computational screening, metal-organic frameworks, machine learning, sorption and separation]
